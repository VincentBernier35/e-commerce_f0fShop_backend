The overall project is to create a secure e-commerce API
as well as an independent app which is a front client consuming this API. This repo is the API app.

## For this project we were a team of 4 people

- 2 for the backend (Jérémie VALETTE and myself Vincent BERNIER)
  We worked in agile method (scrum)
